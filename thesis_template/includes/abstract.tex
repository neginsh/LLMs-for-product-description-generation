\chapter*{Abstract}

In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend towards online shopping and e-commerce has grown to be a driving force in the global economy and is generating massive sales volumes. One of the most important factors in the success of an online shop is in how they present their products and make them look more engaging. This study looks into the domain of automating product description generation in e-commerce utilizing transformer-based large language models (LLMs). Online retailers face difficulties bridging the gap between structured internal product representations and semi-structured representation of storefronts, restricting their ability to create engaging and informative descriptions. Transformer-based LLMs, such as BLOOM, display impressive language processing capabilities. Hence, this research explores the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing these models to overcome challenges in selecting product features and generating coherent text. Moreover, the thesis investigates localization challenges and presents potential solutions using transformer-based LLMs in different languages. The findings of this study contribute to the advancement of knowledge and practical implementation of LLMs in automating and enhancing product descriptions, thereby enabling enhanced customer engagement in the domain of e-commerce. Nevertheless, it's important to note that, despite using challenging data, complex language, and a comparatively small model, we simply provide a proof of concept for automatic generation of product description in this thesis.
