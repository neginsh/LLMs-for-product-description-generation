I am really thankful to my research adviser, Lorenz Wendlinger, for his crucial advice and ongoing assistance throughout this study. I would also want to thank my examiner and supervisor, Prof. Dr. Michael Granitzer, for his assistance in making this study a success. This thesis would not have been possible without their mentorship. Special thanks to PBS Holding AG for providingÂ the data, which greatly enhanced our research.
